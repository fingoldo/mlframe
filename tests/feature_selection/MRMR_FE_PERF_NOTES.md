# MRMR FE perf notes (agentic optimization /loop)

Profiling findings to guide the optimization loop. NOTE: prior memory says mlframe perf is mature
(metric kernels / preprocessing / io are bench-tuned; small-n grinding yields no wins) -- so treat
these as CANDIDATES to verify, not assumed wins. Always bench before/after; document no-wins.

## cProfile: MRMR().fit on CASE2 n=20000 (2026-06-13, tottime, mlframe-side)

| tottime | ncalls | function | note |
|--------:|-------:|----------|------|
| 3.88s | 18 | `discretization/_kernels.py:_searchsorted_2d_right_njit_parallel` | njit_parallel; **18 calls** -- one per fit/FE step? possible redundant re-discretisation |
| 3.44s | 18 | `discretization/_kernels.py:_quantile_edges_2d_njit` | same 18× cadence -- edges recomputed each step |
| 2.51s | 2 | `_feature_engineering_pairs/_pairs_materialise.py:_materialise_chunk` | FE pair materialisation |
| 2.34s(cum) | 34 | `_orthogonal_univariate_fe/_orth_extra_basis_fe.py:_detect_fourier` | Fourier-basis detection in orth FE |
| 0.57s | 1564 | `_orth_extra_basis_fe.py:_corr_sq_centered` | many small calls |

Total fit ~50s (n=20k, includes FE + escalation + orth basis).

### Lead candidate for next iteration
The 18x `_searchsorted_2d_right` + `_quantile_edges_2d` calls (7.3s combined, ~15% of fit) suggest the
discretised matrix / quantile edges are RECOMPUTED per FE step rather than cached+extended when FE
appends columns. If the existing columns' edges are stable across steps, caching them and only
discretising the NEWLY-appended engineered columns would cut this. VERIFY first: confirm the 18 calls
are on overlapping column sets (redundant) vs genuinely new data each time; bench the cache; ensure
bit-identical selection (edges must be frozen identically). Mature-perf caveat: may already be
intentional (FE changes nbins/strategy per step) -- check before assuming redundancy.
