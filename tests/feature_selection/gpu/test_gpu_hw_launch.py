"""Unit coverage for ``_gpu_hw_launch.py``'s analytic occupancy / launch-config derivation.

X_TEST_COVERAGE_QUALITY-6 fix (mrmr_audit_2026-07-22): this module had zero test references anywhere in
the suite. Exercises the pure-Python occupancy math (``_max_active_blocks_per_sm``,
``occupancy_block_candidates``, ``fill_grid_1d``) against synthetic device-property dicts, plus
``device_props``'s no-cupy fallback -- no real CUDA device is required for any of this.
